# ERD Diamgram was created to show a visual representation of the relationships and cardinality between these attributes and entities.

# Created tables in pgAdmin and transferred data from CSV files into the tables. See scheme below:
<!-- Create table departments (
dept_no Varchar(20) Not Null,
dept_name Varchar(20) Not null,
Primary Key (dept_no)
);

Create Table titles (
title_id Varchar(20) Not Null,
title Varchar(20) Not Null,
Primary Key (title_id)
);

Create Table employees (
emp_no INT Not null,
emp_title_id Varchar(255) Not null,
birth_date Date Not Null,

sex Varchar (255) Not null,
hire_date Date Not Null,
Primary Key (emp_no),
Foreign Key (emp_title_id) References titles (title_id)
);

Create Table dept_manager(

emp_no INT Not Null,
Foreign Key (emp_no) References employees (emp_no),
Foreign Key (dept_no) References departments (dept_no),
	Primary Key (dept_no, emp_no)

Create Table dept_employee(

Create Table salaries(

PRIMARY KEY (emp_no)
);

#Used the tables created to then create queries to answer the following questions:
